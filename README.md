### Housing Price Prediction

This project builds and evaluates machine learning models to predict housing prices based on various features such as the number of bedrooms, total rooms, population, median income, and location.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset (handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and standardized features).

Explored the dataset using statistical summaries and visualizations.

Implemented multiple machine learning models:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

Evaluated models using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score.
